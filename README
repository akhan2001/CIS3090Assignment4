Code Description:
Our code runs just as intended. We've tested it using the format presented in the assignment description, and
can say for certain that as long as the program is ran under the assignment assumptions plus the assumptions
listed below it will run like the pinnacle code of our generation.

Code Assumptions:
The minimum worker count 1, the minimum size is 1, and finally the configurations must be between 0 and 4 inclusive.
